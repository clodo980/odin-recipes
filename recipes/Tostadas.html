<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Spice Rub:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons chipotle chili powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Beef:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 pound) boneless beef chuck roast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup beef stock</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups chopped tomatoes, divided</li>
        <li>1 medium orange, juiced</li>
        <li>½ medium lime, juiced</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Tostadas:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 crispy tostada shells</li>
        <li>2 cups refried beans, warmed</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons salsa, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sour cream, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons guacamole, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>6 wedges lime</li>
    </ul>
 <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare spice rub: Combine chili powder, paprika, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, coriander, cumin, salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Rub 1 tablespoon of the spice rub on each side of the chuck roast. Set remaining spice rub aside for later.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place seasoned roast in the hot oil and brown for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Cook onions in the same skillet, stirring frequently, until they begin to turn clear, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in beef stock, 1/2 cup chopped tomato, orange juice, lime juice, and remaining spice rub.</li>
        <li>Return the roast back to the skillet and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer gently until meat is tender and cooked through, about 2 hours. Remove meat from the skillet and transfer to a cutting board.</li>
        <li>Carefully pour the skillet contents into a blender or food processor. Pulse several times, until sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li>Remove the visible fat from the meat and discard. Shred the meat with two forks. Place shredded beef back into the skillet with about 3/4 cup of the pureed tomato sauce. Add more, if desired, to adjust the consistency. Refrigerate any unused tomato sauce in a sealed container for another use, if desired.</li>
        <li>To assemble tostadas, spread about 1/3 cup refried beans on each tostada shell. Top with layers of shredded beef mixture, lettuce, Cheddar cheese, and reserved chopped tomatoes. Drizzle with salsa and add a dollop of sour cream and guacamole. Garnish with cilantro and serve with lime wedges.</li>
   </ol>
   
   <aside>Cook's Notes: I've included a recipe for the shredded beef, but you can use leftover roast beef that has been shredded if you prefer. You can use a shortcut from the grocery store for the refried beans, or you can make your own.</aside>
